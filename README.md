# Overview

As a software engineer, I am always looking for ways to learn and improve. This project is designed to enhance my skills in using tools like Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub, and Python together. ðŸ’»âœ¨

This is a simple forum application called Discuzzia, showcasing how these tools can work together in a cohesive development setup.

I created it to improve my coding skills, version control practices, and usage of development environments. It's also a step towards becoming better at code management and collaborating with others effectively.
